    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div className="about-content">
      <p>I'm an economics & computer science student at the University of Pittsburgh with a passion for finance, data-driven decision-making, and investment strategy. As a Senior Analyst at Panther Equity, I research consumer and healthcare equities, build valuation models, and contribute to investment pitches. At InvestIQ LLC, I refined trading algorithms and collaborate with analysts and engineers to enhance AI-driven trading strategies. Beyond finance, I enjoy staying active playing pickleball and volleyball, and when I'm not analyzing market trends, you can find me revisiting my favorite 2010s pop hits.</p>
